## About
GitTrends is a project made using Flutter which displays all the trending repositories and developers for the current day, week or month. There is no official API provided by GitHub to show the trending repositories and developers for any certain time period, and GitTrends tackles exactly this problem.

## Configuration Steps
1. Cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahmedgulabkhan/GitTrends.git
```

2. Open the project and install dependencies (using terminal):

```
$ cd GitTrends
$ flutter pub get
```
This installs all the required dependencies.

3. Now run the app on your connected device (using terminal):

`$ flutter run`
