## About
GitTrends is an app made using Flutter which displays all the trending repositories, developers for the current day, week or month. The GitHub mobile app does not support the feature to show the trending repositories, developers and also there is no official GitHub API which does the same, and GitTrends tackles exactly this problem.

## Configuration Steps
1. Cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahmedgulabkhan/GitTrends.git
```

2. Open the project and install dependencies (using terminal):

```
$ cd GitTrends
$ flutter pub get
```
This installs all the required dependencies.

3. Now run the app on your connected device (using terminal):

`$ flutter run`
